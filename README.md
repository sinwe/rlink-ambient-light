# **Renault GS/BS Ambient Light**

*This article applies to all Renault Grand Scenic (Bose and Non-Bose) or Baby Scenic (Privilege and Standard)*



## Overview

The Bose and Privilege Ambient Light (after this I’ll just call it ambient light) is a beautiful light accessories that synchronised and controlled by Rlink. These ambient light are emitted by LEDs that emit (I’ll call it emitter) multi-colour: red, blue, green, yellow and violet.

Physically there are 2 forms of emitters:

1. Emitters with 3 LEDs (RGB)
2. Emitters with 1 LED but can equally emit 5 colours.



By default, following are places where the ambient light can be located:

|                                                              | 1. Gear stick base (gear)![Gear Base](https://github.com/sinwe/rlink-ambient-light/raw/master/Article%20Images/Gear%20Base.jpg) |                                                              |

| 3. Front left door pocket (FLP)                              |                                                              | 5. Front right door pocket (FRP)![Front right door pocket](https://github.com/sinwe/rlink-ambient-light/raw/master/Article%20Images/Ambient%20Light%20Front%20Right%20Pocket.png) |
| 6. Rear left door handle (RLH)                               |                                                              | 7. Rear right door handle (RRH)                              |
| 8. Rear left door pocket (RLP)![Rear Left door pocket](https://github.com/sinwe/rlink-ambient-light/raw/master/Article%20Images/Ambient%20Light%20Rear%20Left%20Pocket.png) |                                                              | 9. Rear right door pocket (RRP)![Rear right door pocket](https://github.com/sinwe/rlink-ambient-light/raw/master/Article%20Images/Ambient%20Light%20Rear%20Right%20Pocket.png) |

However the last 2 locations (RLP & RRP) only have the slot to store the ambient light, but there is no hole to let the light passthrough and shine the door pocket.

Out of these 9 locations, only location 1 is using emitters with 3 LEDs, the rest are using emitters with 1 LED. Therefore location 2 - 9 are interchangeable from physical form point of view.



## Availability & Pre-Requisite

### Default availability:

- Bose: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Privilege: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and in some batches also have 3 and 5

## Installation

### GS Bose/BS Privilege

1. For Bose and Privilege, no activation is required as they are already activated.
2. Once location is decided, material is acquired (for strip, you need to buy "fibre optic", a kind of transparent plastic tube that can transmit light), and switch to connect to is determined, just tap the data wire from the existing nearest location.

### Other GS/BS

1. Decide location to install
2. Activate the relevant location (Dashboard, Front or Rear)
3. Acquire materials (LED emitter, fibre optic)

Make appointment with Daren from AutoTrend workshop in Toa Payoh for "Morning slot" and ask for his worker named "**Ah Keong**" to do Renault LED ambient light. For Bose/Privilege, usually Ah Keong can install 2 new locations for 2-2.5 hours. However for non-Bose and non-Privilege, it might take 3-3.5 hours for 2 new location.
